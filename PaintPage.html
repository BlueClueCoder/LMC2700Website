            <h1>Painting</h1>

            <div class="greenbox">
            <p>
               I've enjoyed trying to paint since highschool.  I'm still an amateur, 
               but it's a nice way to relax while still creating something new.
            </p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            
            <div class="bluebox">
            <p>Most of the paintings done on canvas are heavily based off of videos I watched on YouTube.
                This hobby also crosses over into my love of board games.  I quickly discovered an entire
                body of knowledge focused around painting the miniatures that come with the games.

            <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
            
            <div class="tealbox">
            <p>Below is a list of the general concepts I've picked up.  I really push myself to paint thoughtfully, that is,
                to actually think about the techniques I'm using while I paint a canvas or miniature.  I still get lazy, but I
                think I'm getting better because I see the results. 
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="bluebox">
            <ul>
                <li>Start painting every model by spraying it with black or white primer.</li>
                <li>Paint your model one color at a time, and don't go back for mistakes until you've cycled through each color once.</li>
                <li>Don't worry if your base coat looks flat.  Washes and hilights will fix this.</li>
                <li>After adding a base coat, washes can be your best friend in giving your mini shadow and depth.</li>
                <li>Use hilighting at the very end to pick out one or two important pieces of your mini.</li>
                <li>Don't over apply your spray finish, or your model will have a "wet" look.</li>
            </ul>
