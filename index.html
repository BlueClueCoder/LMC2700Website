                Hi my name's Elliott.  This site is intended to represent my interests and hobbies. My goal is to support anyone who
                enjoys similar things, and to provide them with ways to learn more about anything that catches their attention. 
              </p>
              </div>

            <div class="tealbox">
            <p>I am a 3rd year student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Computational Media major.  I am focusing on the Games and Media threads
              and intend to design and develop video games in the future. 
            </p>

            <div class="bluebox">
              <p>A few things I don't know much about but would like to learn more about is A.I. , astronomy, bird watching, history, and film techniques.</p>

            <div class="greenbox">
            <p>I love board games, dogs, and all things horror - related.  I paint in my free time, and am obsessed with heavy metal covers of popular songs, 
              especially Disney villain songs.  Some things I could talk forever about are random animal facts, the meaning behind movies, and what makes a game fun.

            <div class="tealbox">
            <p>I get bored talking about celebrity culture, anything sports related (but I respect anyone who keeps up with it), and personality tests.</p>
