        <h1>Games</h1>
        
        <div class="greenbox">
        <p>Board games have always been a large part of my life.  Over the years, I have accumulated a pretty large collection.  Now, I feel I've gotten better at judging whether or not 
        I'd actually play a game before I buy it.  Georgia Tech has been the perfect place to find a group to play with, and I've had the privilege of
        experiencing all sorts of games which I hadn't even heard of before coming here. 
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Best of the Best</h2>
        <div class="bluebox">
        <p>While there will always be debate over which games are the best of their kind, I believe that not all board games are created equal.
            Here are some of my favorites, technically in order, but I'm sure this will change over time.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gloomhaven</li>
            <li>Twilight Imperium</li>
            <li>Scythe</li>
            <li>Twilight Struggle</li>
            <li>Great Western Trail</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Explain a Game</h2>
        
        <div class="tealbox">
        <p>If you're "the game guy", the person responsible for bringing and teaching people the rules to board games, you've
            no doubt dealt with the struggle of quickly and effectively explaining a game.  You have to walk the line between
            making sure everyone has a fair understanding of how to play, and not boring them with a 30 minute lecture.  The channel
            Shut Up & Sit Down has an excellent video on this topic, which I've linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5fjDaFuft8">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>But if you don't have time for that, here is a basic summary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bluebox">
        <ul class="no-bullets">
            <li>Know how to play before teaching.</li>
            <li>Allow your friends to touch the game's pieces.</li>
            <li>Say WHO we are, HOW we win, and WHY this game is fun.</li>
            <li>Use people's names when you give examples.</li>
            <li>Rehearse your explanation before people show up.</li>
            <li>Encourage and reward questions. EXAMPLE: "That's a really good question!"</li>
            <li>If someone else knows how to play, collaborate instead of talking over one another.</li>
            <li>Play a "fake" round to clear up misconceptions.</li>
            <li>Begin game night with a shorter, simpler game.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
        
        <div class="greenbox">
        <p>Here at Georgia Tech, I am majoring in Computational Media, and am focusing on the threads of Games and Media.  My dream career is to take part in the creation of board and video games.
        Right now, I am enrolled in a Games Studies course, and have had the experience of designing a prototype.

        <p>This gave me insight into the process of brainstorming, designing, developing, playtesting, and revising a game.  What was most encouraging to me was
        that I loved every second of it.  This project dismissed any doubts I had about pursuing the wrong major.</p>
